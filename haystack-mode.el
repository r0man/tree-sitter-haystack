;; Minor mode for Clojure and Java Stacktraces

;;; Code:

(defun haystack-setup ()
  "Setup treesit for html-ts-mode."
  ;; (setq-local treesit-font-lock-settings
  ;;              (apply #'treesit-font-lock-rules
  ;;                   html-ts-font-lock-rules)))
  ;; ;; This handles indentation -- again, more on that below.
  ;; (setq-local treesit-simple-indent-rules html-ts-indent-rules)
  ;; ... everything else we talk about go here also ...
  ;; End with this
